          <p>
            Family is at the heart of why Gilsomar Matos decided to start Euro
            Solar. After working for 3 years with another company, he decided to
            set out on his own and create a company that truly reflects his
            values. He and his wife recently introduced their first baby to the
            family, and he looks forward to creating a business that his family
            can be proud of â€“ a legacy to pass on.
